# Movie-Review-Classifier

Used Sentiment Analysis to build a predictor that classifies positive and negative movie reviews. Used a dataset of 50,000 reviews provided by IMDb. Uses Python's Pickle Module, SQLite, and Flask for a web application to prompt a user for a review, make a prediction, and close the application without having to reload the dataset. Real world usage of this project could include apps for spam detection or recommendaiton systems.
